# KerberSpray
A Python-based Kerberos password spraying tool that wraps [`impacket-getTGT`](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) to check for valid user/password combinations against a Windows Domain Controller. Supports a user file, password file, logs outputs, and .ccache ticket generation. This has been done before, and probably better just wanted to whip something up for a htb challenge I was doing.

## üß∞ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)
